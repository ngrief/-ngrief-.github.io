Project Notebooks
1. NoSQL Setup
This notebook sets up the MongoDB database:

Imports data into MongoDB from a CSV/JSON file.
Verifies data upload and structure.
2. NoSQL Analysis
This notebook performs analysis using MongoDB queries:

Fetch establishments based on hygiene ratings.
Perform geospatial queries to find establishments near a location.
Aggregate data by Local Authority to identify trends.
Key Queries:
Fetch establishments in a specific region: Retrieve data filtered by a region or rating.
Top establishments: Identify establishments with the highest ratings.
Hygiene score aggregation: Group establishments by Local Authority with hygiene scores of 0.
Example Commands
Import Data into MongoDB
bash
Copy code
mongoimport --db uk_food --collection establishments --file establishments.json --jsonArray
Start MongoDB Shell
bash
Copy code
mongo
Run Python Script
Ensure your script connects to MongoDB:

python
Copy code
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
db = client['uk_food']
establishments = db['establishments']
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MongoDB not running:
Start MongoDB with: mongod
Import errors:
Check if all required libraries are installed (pymongo, pandas, etc.).
